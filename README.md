3. **Empty Row Removal**

   - Identified and removed duplicate entries using Excelâ€™s *Remove Duplicates* feature.

   - Manually reviewed and corrected spelling errors in cell values.

6. **Whitespace Cleanup**

7. **Department Name Fix**
   - Department names were incorrectly split over two columns.
   - Merged the values into a single column using *Flash Fill*.
